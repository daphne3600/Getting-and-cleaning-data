This CodeBook explains the work on Coursera "Getting and cleaning data" course project Oct 2016.

* R scripts were developed running R 3.2.5 on Windows 10. plyr (v 1.8.4), dplyr (0.5.0), downloader (0.4) and reshape2 (1.4.2) packages were installed and are loaded as part of the processing script.

===========================================================

Processed data: Test set and training set were combined to a single data set also including the subject and activity types. The variables were renamed to be descriptive, so 'Subject', 'Activity', and the 561 feature names (= variables) were chosen. Activity was originally coded 1-6, this was changed to the actual activity ('STANDING' etc) for clarity. Because we are interested in a statistical analysis of mean and standard deviation of the measurements, only the features with mean() or std() in the feature name were chosen for extraction (along with Subject and Activity). Finally a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was prepared. It has rows for all (mean) obervations and columns for all variables.

The script is described in more detail in the ReadMe.md

The tidy data set contains IDs (Subject and Activity) and the mean of the 66 variables:

The data was processed (using melt and dcast) to generate a row for each combination of Subject and Activity.

========================================================

* Experimental design and background: In order to better understand "wearables", experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities ('WALKING', 'WALKING_UPSTAIRS', 'WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS', 'SITTING', 'STANDING', 'LAYING') wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

* Raw data: The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

* Raw data source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip (downloaded on: 23-Oct-2016) included the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
